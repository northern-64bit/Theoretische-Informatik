# Theoretische-Informatik

This is a personal summary I completed during my time as a Teaching Assistant 
   for this course at ETH Zurich. It is not an official document and the content 
   is neither **complete** nor does it **guarantee** to be correct.

   I tried to give examples to accompany the theory and show some common recipes to solve certain exercises. 
   
   If you find any mistakes or inconsistencies, I would be very happy about a quick message so that I can correct them;)

   You can reach me under [nwehrl@student.ethz.ch](mailto:nwehrl@student.ethz.ch) 
   and the LaTex Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/nwehrli/Theoretische-Informatik).

   The corresponding slides from my exercise session are available on a small [website](https://n.ethz.ch/~nwehrl/TheoInf) of mine.
   
   Note that the summary does not cover 'Grammatiken' since this was only covered 
   after the second midterm in the autumn semester of 2023. 
   The non-deterministic hierarchical stuff (section 6.4 in the german version of the book) 
   was also not covered since the endterm preparation was prioritised.

   These parts may be added later.
   

   Hope this helps. Good luck in your future and may you achieve your goals!

   Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
